    - In this assignment, we must complete three problem (N-Puzzle, Sudoku, Finding path) relate to 
    search algorithm and informed algorithm (Depth First Search, Genetic Algorithm, A* Algorithm).
    - Environment : python 3.8
    - Implemented problem at least three file (include README.md).
    - Comment , explain clearly each function in each file.
    -  Problems can be formulated as a problem as follows:
        - 'State'
        - 'Initial State'
        - 'Goal State'
        - 'Legal moves'
        - 'Heuristic Function'
## Finding Path

### Implementation
    - Implement Finding Path based on A* Algorithm.
### Compile and run
- For compute:
    - python code.py
- For simulation
(please read carefully introduction in header of file astar.py):
    - python astar.py

### Result
    - Grid (start, goal, wall and weight of each locationa and road from start to goal) on terminal
